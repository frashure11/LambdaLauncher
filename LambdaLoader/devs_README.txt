Thanks for taking the time to read this!

* This program is functional, but far from finished with the scrope I have in mind
* Map cycle generation as far as I know does not have bugs associated with it. All my issues are with the extra features the program offers.
* The first window you see when running the program is the Game Profile selector.
        - I want this program to support players who may have different Half-Life setups that they switch between and the Game Profile selector would make this easy on them. All settings would be saved to a separate profile folder
        - This feature is somewhat implemented, but not finished
* There seem to be some odd issues when launching a listen server. I have had a friend host servers launched from this program and when I would join matches the map files would sometimes be saved to valve_downloads/overviews instead of the normal /valve_downloads/maps and I can find no documentation on what this folder is and why it would be generated.
